      <h2> Maxwell Gontarek </h2>
      <h3> From RAPIDES</h3>
<br>
Reddish basis<br>
inflected The surrounding countryside<br>
    <br>
Goats stretched by horizons, by a<br>
Machine that is not new<br>
    <br>
It was luminous it was paranoia without effort<br>
Throught<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rebounding its read under<br>
    <br>
The ecru, the plates, the bindweed<br>
Linkage like<br>
    <br>
Drawing, without running dry<br>
The blancher<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(We will have thirst, we will be drunk<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth, out of my thirst, returns outside)<br>
    <br>
v. powder Gave push<br>
well att. in the dials<br>
    <br>
Spain instep; low-lat<br>
in en and pedis<br>
    <br>
In two, as if I had staked myself on the gap,<br>
breathe, like I ante, without me, insisting through the center<br>
    <br>
the cold of the air, it’s the air again several times<br>
Narcotic as a derivation<br>
    <br>
If you are words, speak<br>
The wall to whom one walks<br>
