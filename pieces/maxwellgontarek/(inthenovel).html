      <h2> Maxwell Gontarek </h2>
      <h3> From RAPIDES</h3>
<br>
In the novel I recounted the life of a specific prisoner<br>
In the film it is my whole sister<br>
    <br>
In the beast's shining eyes, the sea was an obstacle<br>
In the words are rebels, but they are good nets<br>
    <br>
What to differentiate<br>
What to, I repeat, in the torturous transition from oil to bird<br>
    <br>
I was about to leave I was about to end their radiant consolidation<br>
It was three minutes before my departure I was about to eat dinner<br>
    <br>
It was a throwing of projects like someone passing a thread through fire<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the prairie bent into a point and came suddenly against the train<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With stars and cups with little bulls and everything Exclaiming<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an old song &quot;how many times yesterday&quot; If that yesterday<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that has already ceased to be a project That torturous<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yesterday without skipping Repeated inexorably Humming<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time like cream on that cup of already cold And<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;another will be the hour That has already eaten<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all its seconds<br>
Puce (1)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-61- subsidizes<br>
    <br>
At Elche<br>
Or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I meant contraction<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like an oil stain on the ocean<br>
