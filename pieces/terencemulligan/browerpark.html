      <h1> Brower park's cold today </h1>
      <h3> for Frankie and those like her</h3><br>
Frankie Baker stepped down from<br>
The stoop of her apartment<br>
Quite distressed after a night<br>
Of heavy drinking, alone, and<br>
Depressed. This was the fourth day<br>
This week she’s emerged at the ripe<br>
Time of three o’clock to grab coffee<br>
Along with a croissant.<br>
<br>
She goes back up to her<br>
Big, dark, cold apartment<br>
To garnish her coffee with a dash of<br>
Whisky and baileys. She grabs her bag,<br>
Inside it is a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Notebook
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Pencil
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Toni Morrison’s Jazz
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Cough Drops
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Mints
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Advil
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Chapstick
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Tobacco & Papers
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Two Lighters
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Napkins<br>
And a handgun.<br>
<br>
She walks back downstairs with her bag<br>
On her side and heads for<br>
The park. She takes her usual route<br>
Down Sterling, turning on Hampton to<br>
Look at the cute stoops, and see if<br>
There’s any books worth taking.<br>
Nothing today, but a cat startles her<br>
And she almost drops her strong coffee.<br>
<br>
Upon getting into the park she sees<br>
Albert, her husband, lounging on a<br>
Blanket centerfield. He has in front<br>
Of him<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Roses
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- A Basket of Food
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Two Plates
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- A Bottle of Wine
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Two Glasses<br>
A very romantic gesture, something<br>
Frankie would love.<br>
<br>
She makes her way towards him,<br>
Reaching in her bag for the<br>
Chapstick and applying it as<br>
She walks up to him.<br>
“Hey babe, what you doing?” She asks,<br>
As he turns around noticing her.<br>
“Shit, what? What you doing here?”<br>
Obviously startled... he stands up quick,<br>
“I mean, look, I thought you would<br>
Turn up sometime. I got this set<br>
Up all for you.” He says, looking around<br>
Past her, for something else, someone<br>
Else. She pretends to be fooled,<br>
“This is so cute babe, well what you<br>
Waiting for? Sit me down, pour me<br>
A glass of that wine.” She sits and<br>
Looks into the basket, sandwiches.<br>
<br>
She holds out a glass waiting for<br>
Albert to pour wine in it. She looks<br>
Up at him and shakes the glass,<br>
“What? Were you not expecting me?”<br>
She smiles at him, putting the glass back<br>
Down and eating some grapes.<br>
Albert sits down,<br>
“Of course I was expecting you, what<br>
You talking about babe?” He again looks past her, this time his<br>
seeming alerted,<br>
He leans in to kiss Frankie,<br>
“Girl, you smell like whisky.”<br>
She backs away from him, reaching into<br>
Her bag again, “What about it?” She says<br>
Pulling out her tobacco and papers.<br>
<br>
Albert looks past Frankie again as<br>
She rolls her cigarette. He pours both<br>
Himself and Frankie a glass of wine,<br>
Puts some grapes on his plate, and<br>
Eats a few.<br>
“I missed you last night,” he says,<br>
“I had to work late, you know, Damon’s<br>
Been on my ass about getting this<br>
Project done on time, I—“<br>
<br>
“You don’t gotta explain anything,<br>
I know you’d rather be home.” She said<br>
Lighting her cigarette. “Only thing is,<br>
I know home ain’t at my place no more,”<br>
She puts her tobacco, papers, and lighter<br>
Next to her bag, and sips a bit of<br>
The wine Albert poured her.<br>
“I don’t know what you talking about<br>
Girl. That’s my place too, that’s my<br>
Only home.” He replied, gulping his wine,<br>
Eating a few grapes. He reaches into the<br>
Basket and grabs a sandwich, “What<br>
You do last night?” He asks before taking<br>
A bite. “What if I told you I saw a man<br>
Last night, and had a grand ol’ time<br>
Pretending it was him I married?” She<br>
Asked, blowing smoke into his face.<br>
He almost choked on his sandwich,<br>
“Are you fucking crazy? You didn’t,<br>
Did you?” She took another hit, then<br>
Put it out in the grass, “No, I’m<br>
Just asking a silly question, what<br>
Would you do?” She said, then chugged<br>
The rest of her coffee.<br>
<br>
“I would probably ask who,” he said<br>
Looking past her, then back at her in<br>
The eyes, “then I would find him, shoot<br>
Him, come back home, have a last glass<br>
Of whisky, then shoot myself. Because I<br>
Ain’t doing prison again.” He said<br>
Straight faced, unwaveringly, then<br>
Came back to reality, “why, did you?”<br>
<br>
She looks behind her at someone sitting<br>
On a bench, the person turns their head<br>
Quickly as soon as Frankie looked in<br>
Their direction. Albert speaks abruptly<br>
Again, “What up Frankie, you acting<br>
Weird today, you ain’t get enough<br>
Sleep?” He grabs her on the shoulder,<br>
“Boy get off me, so is that <i>her?</i>” She<br>
Points to the person on the bench,<br>
Looking at Albert, he’s flustered,<br>
Spills his glass of wine. “Is that who?<br>
What you talking about? I don’t know<br>
That woman.” He says trying to clean<br>
The spill.<br>
<br>
Frankie refills her glass of wine,<br>
Then gets up, grabs her bag,<br>
And makes her way towards the woman<br>
Sitting on the bench while Albert is<br>
Distracted trying to clean his mess.<br>
Once he notices he jumps up, and tries<br>
To follow, but Frankie is already<br>
Plenty ahead of him. She reaches the<br>
Woman on the bench, “I think this is<br>
Your glass of wine, sorry for taking<br>
Your seat, love. What’s your name?”<br>
“Um, uh, I’m Josephine. Hi?” The woman<br>
On the bench introduced herself.<br>
“What is going on here? Albert, who<br>
Is this woman?” Josephine addresses<br>
Albert as he walks up. “So this is<br>
Her.” Frankie says. She drops the<br>
Glass of wine she was holding.<br>
It shatters on the ground, startling<br>
Both Josephine and Albert, who jump,<br>
And then when they realize what is<br>
Happening, it’s too late.<br>
<br>
Frankie pulled out the gun from<br>
Her bag, and almost immediately after<br>
The sound of glass shattering, there<br>
Was another sound that filled the air.<br>
A loud ring, echoing through<br>
The park. That sound came twice,<br>
Following that were cries,<br>
The screams of others panicking,<br>
And Albert screaming in pain.<br>
<br>
“We always think so similarly, almost<br>
Exactly alike, I love that about<br>
Us. It feels like there’s<br>
Something to learn, something to<br>
Grow from. Except this time, you<br>
Were just wrong. Yeah, I agree with<br>
Killing the you cheat with, Josephine<br>
Had to go. And I’ll kill myself as well<br>
Prison’s no place to live life. But why<br>
Would I let you live? You were<br>
Supposed to be my man,<br>
And you done me wrong.<br>
I don’t think it’d be fair to me,<br>
Nor poor Josephine, if you had the<br>
Opportunity to do this all over again.<br>
And we both know you’d do it again.<br>
<br>
You’re just a man<br>
And you do the world wrong.”<br>
<br>
She caressed his face as she<br>
Lay beside him and<br>
Gave him one final kiss.<br>
A third roar soared through<br>
The big, empty, cold park.<br>
